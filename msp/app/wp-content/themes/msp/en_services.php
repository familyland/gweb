The objective was to create inventions which underpinned their AV strategy, and which could be used to support related services. We delivered inventions which, because of their timing and diversity, added to those from our customer’s own research teams. Our customer has filed patents on inventions that brought new and unexpected elements to the field and plans to introduce related services.</p>

                            <p>Iprova has created an invention that allows an autonomous vehicle to carry out health checks on its passengers. The advanced sensors which are built into an autonomous vehicle allow the motion of the vehicle to be controlled in a precise and predictable way as it travels. By controlling small variations in its motion, the vehicle can generate different forces that can be used to carry out various human health checks. The invention can be used to assess a passenger’s balance and core stability, or evaluate the body’s response to known stimuli. This will help passengers to conveniently check various aspects of their health by harnessing the motion of the vehicle itself.</p>
