        <p>At M&S Partners, we believe that it is vital that we, as patent attorneys, have the balanced core skills of: (i) legal skills; (ii) technical skills; and (iii) foreign language skills. In particular, highly specialized technical knowledge and legal knowledge are necessary when we prepare patent applications. Strong language skills are also required in handling foreign patent applications, including U.S. patent applications, as well as in communicating with our foreign clients in a smooth manner. As professional patent attorneys with high levels of these three fundamental skills, we are committed to delivering high quality services to our clients.</p>
